"""
The application factory for this project.
When new blueprints are created, they must be registered with the application inside create_app.

This module should maintain the sole purpose of housing the create_app
function and some basic support functions. Routes don't go here; they go in blueprints.

Larger projects may have multiple application modules, such as cronapp.py or apiapp.py,
but app.py should always contain the factory for the "primary" end-user facing 
website application.
